Congratulations! You've successfully:

* ✅ Configured MCP servers for Honeycomb and Pulumi (OAuth-based, no API keys!)
* ✅ Connected Claude Code to your observability and infrastructure data
* ✅ Used natural language to query Honeycomb traces
* ✅ Asked AI agent to diagnose performance bottleneck (LLM latency, not infrastructure)
* ✅ Passed diagnosis to Pulumi Neo for comprehensive analysis
* ✅ Neo analyzed BOTH infrastructure and application code
* ✅ Received prioritized recommendations with impact analysis
* ✅ Neo generated code patches and created a Pull Request (human-in-the-loop)
* ✅ Understood streaming solution reduces perceived latency by 90%
* ✅ Learned the end-to-end agentic workflow for AI-powered operations

## What's Next?

In the **Cleanup** section, you'll tear down all the resources you've deployed to avoid ongoing costs.
