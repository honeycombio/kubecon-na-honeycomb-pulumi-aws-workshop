Transform your observability pipeline from passive monitoring to active optimization with AI agents that can diagnose and remediate infrastructure issues. In this hands-on workshop, you'll build a closed-loop system where AI analyzes Honeycomb telemetry data and automatically proposes infrastructure fixes through Pulumi.



## You'll learn to:

* Deploy and instrument GenAI workloads on AWS using Pulumi and OpenTelemetry
* Configure AI agents to interpret observability data and identify resource constraints
* Implement automated infrastructure optimization with human-in-the-loop controls
* Generate and review infrastructure-as-code patches using Pulumi Neo

## Who should attend
Perfect for platform engineers and SREs looking to leverage AI for infrastructure management while maintaining enterprise compliance. Basic familiarity with AWS, Kubernetes, and observability concepts recommended.
