In this module, you'll use Honeycomb to analyze the telemetry data from your instrumented application. You'll learn how to query observability data, identify performance bottlenecks, and discover resource constraints that need remediation.

## Module Overview

**Duration:** 20 minutes

**Objectives:**
- Generate realistic load on the application
- Explore traces in Honeycomb's interface
- Use Honeycomb's query builder to analyze patterns
- Identify performance bottlenecks (OpenSearch queries, Bedrock calls)
- Discover resource constraints (undersized ECS tasks)
- Create custom visualizations and boards
