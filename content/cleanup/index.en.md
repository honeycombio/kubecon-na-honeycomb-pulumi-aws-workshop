## Overview

To avoid ongoing AWS charges, it's important to clean up all resources created during this workshop. Follow these steps carefully to ensure complete cleanup.

::alert[**Important**: If you're attending an AWS-hosted workshop event with pre-provisioned accounts, **no cleanup is required**. The workshop organizers will handle resource cleanup automatically after the event.]{type="info"}

::alert[**Self-Paced Learners**: If you're running this workshop on your own AWS account, **you must complete these cleanup steps** to avoid ongoing charges of ~$100-110/month for the application infrastructure.]{type="warning"}

## Estimated Costs if NOT Cleaned Up

| Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| ECS Fargate | 1 vCPU, 1GB, 24/7 | ~$25 |
| Amazon OpenSearch | t3.small.search, 10GB | ~$40 |
| Application Load Balancer | Basic usage | ~$18 |
| NAT Gateway | Single gateway | ~$32 |
| Amazon ECR | ~10 container images | ~$0.30 |
| CloudWatch Logs | 7-day retention | ~$5 |
| **Total** | | **~$120/month** |

## Cleanup Steps

### Step 1: Destroy Pulumi Stack

The application infrastructure you deployed via Pulumi can be destroyed in a single command:

```bash
cd /workshop/ai-workshop/pulumi
pulumi env run honeycomb-pulumi-workshop-dev -i -- pulumi destroy --yes
```

This will delete:
- ✓ ECS Service and Tasks
- ✓ Application Load Balancer and Target Groups
- ✓ Amazon OpenSearch Domain (~10-15 minutes to delete)
- ✓ ECR Repository and Container Images
- ✓ VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway
- ✓ Security Groups
- ✓ IAM Roles and Policies
- ✓ CloudWatch Log Groups
- ✓ Secrets Manager secrets

**Expected time: 15-20 minutes** (most time spent waiting for OpenSearch domain deletion)

::alert[**Monitor Progress**: You can monitor deletion progress in the AWS Console by navigating to CloudFormation → Stacks (Pulumi uses CloudFormation under the hood).]{type="info"}

### Step 2: Verify Stack Deletion

After destruction completes, verify the stack is gone:

```bash
pulumi stack ls
```

You should see your `dev` stack with no resources:

```
NAME                                                    LAST UPDATE     RESOURCE COUNT  URL
dev                                                     3 minutes ago   0               https://app.pulumi.com/...
```

### Step 3: Remove Pulumi Stack (Optional)

If you want to completely remove the stack from Pulumi Cloud:

```bash
pulumi stack rm dev --yes
```

::alert[**Warning**: This deletes the stack history and state. Only do this if you're sure you won't need to reference this stack again.]{type="warning"}

### Step 4: Clean Up CloudFormation Stacks

If you're running the workshop on your own account (not AWS-hosted event), you also need to delete the pre-deployed CloudFormation stacks:

1. Go to AWS Console → CloudFormation

2. Delete the following stacks (in this order):
   - **EKS Cluster Stack** (name contains "EKS" or "demo-aws-cluster")
   - **VS Code Server Stack** (name contains "VSCode" or "vscode-server")

3. Wait for both stacks to finish deleting (~10 minutes for EKS, ~5 minutes for VS Code Server)

Alternatively, use AWS CLI:

```bash
# Get stack names
aws cloudformation list-stacks --stack-status-filter CREATE_COMPLETE UPDATE_COMPLETE --query 'StackSummaries[?contains(StackName, `workshop`)].StackName' --output table

# Delete EKS cluster stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <EKS-STACK-NAME>

# Delete VS Code Server stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <VSCODE-STACK-NAME>

# Monitor deletion progress
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <STACK-NAME> --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus'
```

### Step 5: Verify All Resources are Deleted

Use these AWS CLI commands to verify no workshop resources remain:

```bash
# Check for remaining ECS clusters
aws ecs list-clusters --query 'clusterArns[?contains(@, `otel-ai-chatbot`) || contains(@, `demo-aws-cluster`)]'

# Check for remaining OpenSearch domains
aws opensearch list-domain-names --query 'DomainNames[?contains(DomainName, `otel-ai-chatbot`)]'

# Check for remaining ECR repositories
aws ecr describe-repositories --query 'repositories[?contains(repositoryName, `otel-ai-chatbot`)]'

# Check for remaining load balancers
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[?contains(LoadBalancerName, `otel-ai-chatbot`)]'

# Check for remaining VPCs (filter for workshop VPCs)
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=tag:Project,Values=otel-ai-chatbot" --query 'Vpcs[].VpcId'
```

If any of these commands return resources, manually delete them via AWS Console or CLI.

### Step 6: Clean Up Honeycomb (Optional)

If you created a Honeycomb account specifically for this workshop:

1. Login to https://ui.honeycomb.io

2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Datasets**

3. Delete the `otel-ai-chatbot` dataset

4. Optionally, delete your Honeycomb account:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Team** → **Delete Team**

::alert[**Note**: Honeycomb has a generous free tier. You may want to keep your account for future observability projects!]{type="info"}

### Step 7: Clean Up Pulumi Cloud (Optional)

If you created a Pulumi Cloud account specifically for this workshop:

1. Login to https://app.pulumi.com

2. Navigate to your organization settings

3. Delete the organization (this removes all stacks, state, and history)

Alternatively, just remove the workshop stack:
- Go to **Stacks** → select your `dev` stack → **Settings** → **Delete Stack**

::alert[**Note**: Pulumi has a generous free tier (3,000 resource operations/month). You may want to keep your account for future IaC projects!]{type="info"}

### Step 8: Clean Up Local Files (Optional)

On your local machine or VS Code Server, remove workshop files:

```bash
cd /workshop
rm -rf ai-workshop
```

This removes:
- Cloned workshop repository
- Node.js dependencies
- Generated Docker images (local cache)
- CloudWatch log data (local cache)

## Verification Checklist

Before concluding cleanup, verify:

- [ ] Pulumi stack destroyed successfully (`pulumi stack ls` shows 0 resources)
- [ ] CloudFormation stacks deleted (EKS + VS Code Server)
- [ ] No ECS clusters remaining with "otel-ai-chatbot" or "demo-aws-cluster" in name
- [ ] No OpenSearch domains remaining with "otel-ai-chatbot" in name
- [ ] No ECR repositories remaining with "otel-ai-chatbot" in name
- [ ] No Application Load Balancers remaining with "otel-ai-chatbot" in name
- [ ] No VPCs tagged with Project=otel-ai-chatbot
- [ ] AWS billing dashboard shows expected cost reduction (check in 24-48 hours)

## Troubleshooting Cleanup Issues

### Pulumi Destroy Hangs on OpenSearch Deletion

**Symptom**: `pulumi destroy` is stuck waiting for OpenSearch domain deletion

**Solution**: OpenSearch domain deletion takes 10-15 minutes. If it exceeds 20 minutes:
1. Check AWS Console → OpenSearch Service → Domains
2. Look for domain status (should be "Deleting")
3. If stuck, manually delete via console and then re-run `pulumi destroy`

### "Resource in use" Errors

**Symptom**: Pulumi or CloudFormation reports resources can't be deleted because they're in use

**Common causes and solutions:**

1. **ECS tasks still running**:
   ```bash
   aws ecs update-service --cluster <cluster-name> --service <service-name> --desired-count 0
   aws ecs delete-service --cluster <cluster-name> --service <service-name> --force
   ```

2. **ENIs not detached**:
   - Wait 5 minutes for automatic cleanup
   - Or manually detach via EC2 Console → Network Interfaces

3. **S3 buckets not empty**:
   - Empty the bucket via console or CLI before deletion

### Stack Deletion Fails

**Symptom**: CloudFormation stack deletion fails with errors

**Solution**:
1. Go to AWS Console → CloudFormation → Select the failed stack
2. Click **Events** tab to see error details
3. Manually delete the problematic resource
4. Retry stack deletion

### Unexpected AWS Charges After Cleanup

**Symptom**: You continue to see charges 24-48 hours after cleanup

**Common causes:**
1. **NAT Gateway**: Charged per hour, ensure VPC was deleted
2. **EBS volumes**: Orphaned volumes not deleted with EC2 instances
3. **Elastic IPs**: Unattached EIPs are charged
4. **CloudWatch Logs**: Data storage charges (minimal)

**Solution**: Review AWS Cost Explorer → Filter by service to identify source

## Cost Verification

After cleanup, verify costs are stopping:

1. Go to AWS Console → Billing → Cost Explorer

2. View **Last 7 days** with daily granularity

3. You should see a sharp drop in costs after cleanup day

4. Expected residual costs:
   - $0.01-0.10/day for CloudWatch Logs retention (until 7-day retention expires)
   - $0.00-0.05/day for S3 storage (if any logs were archived)
